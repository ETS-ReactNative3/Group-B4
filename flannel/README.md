# Flannel
Flannel is a web application created using the MERN stack. We wanted to give UCLA students a way to connect with each other based on common interests and this is the main motivation behind Flannel. Whether you want to find people to study for a class final with or go to the gym with, Flannel presents an easy way to search and reach out to people who share these interests! It's as simple as creating an account in which you be shown UCLA students who are in the same classses or have the same interests and affiliations as you. Futhermore, you can search for students based on this criteria with the hope that you will able to connect with the UCLA community in an easy way.  

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## CI Pipeline

CI Pipeline Script
https://github.com/cs130-w22/Group-B4/blob/main/.travis.yml

Travis CI triggers every time a user commits and pushes to GitHub.
Once Travis CI is triggered, the following scripts are run:

before_install is first evoked to remove the node_modules and package_lock.json file.
before_script changes into the flannel directory due to the unconventional hierarchy of our project being within the Group-B4 folder, and installs the react-scripts node module.
script runs npm test to execute our Jest driven test suite. Morever, we run npm run build in order to compile the app for production to the `build` folder and ensure that our build does not fail.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
